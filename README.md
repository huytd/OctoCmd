A blazingly fast app switcher on macOS. No more repeatly <kbd>Cmd + Tab</kbd> to find the app you need. Just hit <kbd>right cmd</kbd> and move on.

## What is this?

**OctoCmd** is an open source application switcher, inspired by [rcmd](https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd/).

It can be used as a replacement for the <kbd>⌘ + Tab</kbd> keystroke to switch between apps.

## How to use?

At anytime, hit the **right command** <kbd>⌘</kbd> key will bring up the OctoCmd main screen. From here, you can press any letter to jump to the corresponding application.

The target letter is the first character in the name of the application running on your machine.

For example:

- <kbd>right ⌘ + C</kbd> for **Google Chrome**
- <kbd>right ⌘ + F</kbd> for **Firefox**
- <kbd>right ⌘ + I</kbd> for **IntelliJ IDEA**

Hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> to dismiss the OctoCmd window. Or hit <kbd>⌘ + Q</kbd> to quit the app.
